#Short text

* Set alternative text to display per breakpoint

##Usage

### Set alternative text for the mobile breakpoint

```html
<p class="short-text-bp30" data-short-text="I'm a good length for mobile">
	I'm quite a long piece of text that is more suited to larger screens
</p>

* Replaced text inherits any font styles from the parent
* Works with both tablet and mobile breakpoints `.short-text-bp20` `.short-text-bp30`
